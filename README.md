<p> A summary of the Browser Wars between Microsoft and Netscape. I want people to understand that Netscape was the first to make a user-friendly web browser and Microsoft followed after them. However, Microsoft quickly captured the web browser market because of the monoploy it created with its PCs. 

I will goes into a summary of how the 'internet search' was created. This will then lead a summary of how Google became the center stage as the popular web browser. </p>

<br> **It's important to understand what web browsers are before understanding the Browser Wars. To first understand what a web browser, let's differentiate between the Internet, World Wide Web, Web server and Web Browsers.** <br>

+ Internet= is a global network of connected computers. The internet was created during the 1960s when the US government, and it grew out of a research program called ARPANet or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. <br>
+ World Wide Web= a network of websites. Founded by Tim Berner's Lee in 1980, he noticed that webpages could be connected to each other like a web. This is an application built on the internet to access, create, and view websites. <br>
+ Web server= a computer that holds one or more websites. The web server will send any webpage from a particular website to the user that requested that web page. <br>
+ Web Browser= A software that allows a person to access the World Wide Web and view all the webpages. When a user rquests a web page, the web browser retrieves the necessary files from the web server and then displays the content. <br>

Now let's move onto the history of the web browser. The first web browser could be attributed to the WWW because it allowed people to view all the webpages. In the case of the Browser Wars, the 'first' web browser to be discussed would be Mosaic. Mosaic was created in 1993 by Marc Andeerssen and Eric Bina. Both were computer science students who had experience with working on the internet. At this point, a few web browsers existed but it was only in certain circles of computer science professional because it was expensive and it worked on certain devices. Marc Andeerssen wanted a web browser that was user friendly, meaning he wanted something easy to use and see. Mosaic was credited as the first web browser that brought more people to the World Wide Web because it was easy to use. Mosaic was also the first to include images embedded in the web pages which made it pleasing to it users. Additionally, future web browsers were built off Mosaic's application. <br>
